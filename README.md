# üåü Advanced React

## üîç Filter( )
The filter() method is used to create a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a specific condition. It does this by executing a callback function on each element of the original array. The callback should return true to include the element in the new array and false to exclude it. This method doesn‚Äôt modify the original array and is often used for tasks like removing unwanted items or narrowing down data.

Key Points:
- Non-mutating: It does not change the original array.
 
- Returns a new array: Contains elements that satisfy the condition.

- Callback Function: The function determines whether each element passes the test.
```
// Example: Filter available products that cost less than $50
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200, available: true },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 20, available: false },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 45, available: true },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 200, available: true },
  { name: "USB Cable", price: 10, available: true }
];

// Use filter to get affordable and available products
const affordableAvailableProducts = products.filter(
  product => product.price < 50 && product.available
);

console.log(affordableAvailableProducts);
// Output: [{ name: "Keyboard", price: 45, available: true }, { name: "USB Cable", price: 10, available: true }]
```

## üî¢ sort( )
The sort() method rearranges the elements of an array in place based on the return value of a comparison function. Without a comparison function, sort() converts the elements to strings and sorts them in lexicographical order. To achieve numerical or custom sorting, you must provide a comparison function.

Key Points:
- Mutates the original array: Unlike filter(), it directly modifies the array.

- Customizable: A comparison function allows for tailored sorting logic.

- Default Behavior: Lexicographical sorting when no comparison function is provided.

```
// Example: Sort products by price in ascending order
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 20 },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 45 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 200 },
  { name: "USB Cable", price: 10 }
];

// Sort products by price (ascending)
products.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);

console.log(products);
// Output:
// [
//   { name: "USB Cable", price: 10 },
//   { name: "Mouse", price: 20 },
//   { name: "Keyboard", price: 45 },
//   { name: "Monitor", price: 200 },
//   { name: "Laptop", price: 1200 }
// ]
```

## üîÑ Map( )
The map() method creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the original array. It‚Äôs often used for transforming data, such as extracting properties, performing calculations, or formatting elements for display. The map() method does not mutate the original array, and the resulting array has the same length as the original.

Key Points:
- Non-mutating: The original array remains unchanged.

- Transforms data: Creates a new array with transformed elements.

- Callback Function: Defines how each element should be transformed.

```
// Example: Extract product names with their prices as strings
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 20 },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 45 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 200 },
  { name: "USB Cable", price: 10 }
];

// Use map to create a list of strings
const productDescriptions = products.map(
  product => `${product.name}: $${product.price}`
);

console.log(productDescriptions);
// Output: 
// [
//   "Laptop: $1200",
//   "Mouse: $20",
//   "Keyboard: $45",
//   "Monitor: $200",
//   "USB Cable: $10"
// ]
```

## React Hooks 
### Hooks Basic Rules:
- You should only call hooks from a React component function ( You should not call hooks inside loops )

- Only call hooks at the **top level** of a React component function ( outside of loops, conditions, and nested functions ) ( You should not call hooks inside if statements ) ( You should not call hooks inside nested functions ) ( You can call multiple state hooks and effect hooks inside a component )

- You are allowed to call multiple state or effect hooks inside a component 

- Make multiple hook calls **in the same sequence**

### ‚öñÔ∏è useReducer( )
The useReducer hook is an alternative to useState for managing state in React components, especially when state logic becomes complex or involves multiple sub-values. It‚Äôs based on the reducer pattern, commonly used in Redux. With useReducer, you define a reducer function that specifies how the state should change in response to different actions.
```
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

// Step 1: Define the reducer function
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case "reset":
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state; // Return current state for unknown actions
  }
}

// Step 2: Use the reducer in a component
function Counter() {
  const initialState = { count: 0 }; // Initial state
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState); // useReducer

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "reset" })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### üìå useRef( )
The useRef hook is a versatile tool in React used to maintain a persistent reference to a value or a DOM element across renders, without causing re-renders when the value changes. It is especially useful for scenarios where you need to:

- Access or modify DOM elements directly.

- Store mutable values that don‚Äôt trigger re-renders (e.g., timers, previous state, or input focus).

- Retain state across renders without causing additional updates.

Key Points:
	1.	Does Not Cause Re-Renders: Unlike useState, updating a useRef value doesn‚Äôt cause the component to re-render.
	2.	Accessing DOM Elements: useRef can store a reference to a DOM element, allowing you to interact with it directly.
	3.	Mutable Object: The useRef hook returns a mutable object with a .current property that you can update.
```
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function FocusInput() {
  // Step 1: Create a ref
  const inputRef = useRef();

  // Step 2: Use the ref to focus the input field
  const handleFocus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Click the button to focus" />
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FocusInput;
```
```
import React, { useState, useRef } from "react";

function RenderCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // State to trigger re-renders
  const renderCount = useRef(0); // Ref initialized to 0

  renderCount.current += 1; // Increment the render count on every render

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Render Count: {renderCount.current}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default RenderCounter;
```

### üåê Fetch( ), Asynchronous Javascript
The fetch() function is a JavaScript method used to make network requests, such as fetching data from a server. It works seamlessly in React for retrieving data from REST APIs or other endpoints. Since network requests are asynchronous, you often combine fetch() with JavaScript tools like Promises or async/await for better control.

In React, we typically use fetch() inside a lifecycle hook like useEffect to ensure that data fetching happens during specific component life cycles.

Key Points:
	1.	Native Browser Method: fetch() is built into JavaScript; no additional library is required.
	2.	Asynchronous Operation: fetch() returns a Promise, so you handle its response using .then() or async/await.
	3.	Common Use in React: Combine fetch() with useEffect to load data when the component mounts.

### üõ† Custom Hooks
Custom hooks are user-defined functions that allow you to encapsulate reusable logic in React. They follow the same rules as built-in hooks and are a great way to share logic between components without duplicating code or relying on higher-order components (HOCs) or render props.

Why Use Custom Hooks?
	1.	Reusability: Custom hooks let you reuse stateful logic (e.g., data fetching, form handling) across multiple components.
	2.	Clean Code: They help you abstract away complex logic, keeping your components focused on rendering UI.
	3.	Separation of Concerns: Move unrelated logic out of components, making them easier to test and maintain.

Key Points About Custom Hooks:
	1.	Naming: A custom hook must start with ‚Äúuse‚Äù (e.g., useFetch, useForm) to follow React‚Äôs hook rules.
	2.	Built-In Hooks Inside: Custom hooks often combine built-in hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) to implement the desired functionality.
	3.	No JSX: Custom hooks don‚Äôt return JSX; instead, they return values, functions, or objects for use in components.
	4.	Follow React‚Äôs Rules: Custom hooks follow the same rules as other hooks (e.g., call them only at the top level, never inside loops or conditions).

### üß© Containment 
Containment in React refers to a design pattern where components act as wrappers for other elements or components. It‚Äôs especially useful when you need a parent component to render unknown or dynamic children passed to it.

Instead of hardcoding child components, you allow them to be passed in via the children prop, making your components more flexible and reusable.

Why Use Containment?
	1.	Flexibility: Allows a parent component to wrap dynamic content without knowing its structure beforehand.
	2.	Reusability: Makes components adaptable to a variety of use cases by simply passing different children.
	3.	Clean Code: Decouples the parent‚Äôs layout/logic from the child‚Äôs content.
 
```
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: "1px solid black", padding: "16px", borderRadius: "8px" }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <p>This is some content inside the Card component.</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```
```
function Layout({ header, sidebar, content }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <header style={{ flexBasis: "100%", padding: "16px", backgroundColor: "#eee" }}>
        {header}
      </header>
      <aside style={{ width: "200px", padding: "16px", backgroundColor: "#ddd" }}>
        {sidebar}
      </aside>
      <main style={{ flex: 1, padding: "16px" }}>{content}</main>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Layout
      header={<h1>My App Header</h1>}
      sidebar={<ul><li>Option 1</li><li>Option 2</li></ul>}
      content={<p>This is the main content of the app.</p>}
    />
  );
}
```

## Children Prop, Component Composition
- Containment: **What it means?** It‚Äôs about passing components inside other components using the children prop. **Why it‚Äôs useful?** It allows you to make flexible and reusable components that ‚Äúcontain‚Äù other elements or components.
  
- Specialization: **What it means?** It‚Äôs about creating a specific version of a more general component. **Why it‚Äôs useful?** It lets you reuse the base functionality of a component but tailor it for specific use cases.

## React.Clone( )
This lets you copy and modify an existing React element. It‚Äôs like creating a ‚Äútwin‚Äù of an element, but you can change its props or add new ones. **Why use it?** When you need to pass additional props or modify existing ones on a child element without directly changing it.
### React.cloneElement( )
The output of React.cloneElement() is a new React element that is a copy of the original element, but with any new or modified props added.

## React.Children( )
This is a helper for working with props.children (the stuff you pass inside a component). It helps inspect, modify, or loop through the children elements safely. **Why use it?** When you need to interact with or manipulate child elements, especially when there are multiple.
### React.Children.map( )
The output of React.Children.map() is a new array of React elements where each element is the result of applying the callback function to each child.
